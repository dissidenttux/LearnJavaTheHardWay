		/* WHAT YOU SHOULD DO ON YOUR OWN
		 * 1. Both Gallant and Goofus swim for the same amount of time.
		 * 2. Gallant and Goofus swim for different amounts this time around. This is because the do-while loop is an exit controlled loop.
		 * 3. Gallant checks the tempurature first.
		 * 4. Goofus jumps in before checking the tempurature.
		 * 5. The difference between a while loop and a do-while loop is that the while loop is a entry controlled loop, and doesn't.
		 * execute at all until conditions are met, whereas the do-while is an exit controlled loop and executes at least once.
		 * 6. The "pre-test loop" equals the while loop; the "post-test loop" equals the do-while loop.
